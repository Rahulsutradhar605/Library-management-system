# Library-management-system
Our library management system project includes modules for adding, deleting, searching, updating, renting, and returning books, as well as displaying available books and exiting the program. Developed by Md Mazharul Haque, Rahul Sutradhar, and Anjali Kumari, this system offers a simple and effective way to manage a library's inventory.
